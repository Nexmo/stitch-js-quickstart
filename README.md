## About the Conversation API

The Nexmo Conversation API enables you to build conversation features where communication can take place across multiple platforms. The context of the conversations is maintained though each communication event taking place within a conversation, no matter the medium.

Currently the Conversation API offers basic IP messaging with the following features:

- Conversation creation and management
- User creation and management
- Sending and receiving text
- Member invite management
- Cache support
- Typing indicators
- Message sent, delivered and read receipts
- Image support

Changes will be communicated with each release outlying what changed. During the Beta it is possible (and probable) that there shall be breaking changes to the SDK and API but these will be explicitly communicated beforehand.
